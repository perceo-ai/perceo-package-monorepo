You are analyzing a {{framework}} application's route and navigation structure to identify distinct user flows.

Route list (pages/routes in the app):
{{routeList}}

Navigation graph (page-to-page edges from Link, navigate, router.push):
{{navigationGraph}}

Auth/role hints (middleware, layout guards, protected routes), if any:
{{authSnippets}}

Identify a SMALL set of essential user flows. Target 6–10 flows for typical apps. Each flow is a meaningful USER JOURNEY or multi-step action that spans 2+ pages or involves a meaningful transition (e.g., "Complete checkout", "Sign in and reach dashboard", "Browse packages and select one").

Requirements:
- STRICT: A flow is NOT a single page view. Do NOT create flows like "View homepage", "View package details", "View signin page", "View dashboard". Those are steps within flows, not flows themselves.
- Each flow must be a multi-step journey or meaningful action: sign-in, checkout, browsing-and-selecting, onboarding, etc. Include all page paths the journey touches (typically 2–5 pages).
- Prefer FEWER flows. 6–8 flows is ideal. Users are charged per flow; excess flows waste money and tokens.
- Do NOT create duplicate or near-duplicate flows. Do NOT create separate flows for "View X" and "View Y" — merge them into broader flows (e.g., "Browse packages" covers homepage, listing, details).
- connectedFlowIds: list flow names this flow leads to when relevant (e.g., "Sign in" connects to "View dashboard"); otherwise leave empty.
- Focus on flows that matter for regression testing: auth, checkout, core browsing, dashboard access.

Return flows with: name, description, pages (array of route paths this flow uses, typically 2–5), connectedFlowIds (array of flow names, may be empty).
