You are analyzing a {{framework}} application's route and navigation structure to identify distinct user flows.

Route list (pages/routes in the app):
{{routeList}}

Navigation graph (page-to-page edges from Link, navigate, router.push):
{{navigationGraph}}

Auth/role hints (middleware, layout guards, protected routes), if any:
{{authSnippets}}

Identify distinct user flows. Each flow must be ONE specific action isolated to one page or at most a couple of pages (e.g., "Submit login form", "Add item to cart", "View dashboard").

Requirements:
- Each flow: a clear name, short description, and the 1-2 page paths (from the route list) that this flow uses.
- Identify how flows connect: when one flow leads to another or shares pages, list connectedFlowIds (names of flows that this flow connects to).
- Prefer many small flows (one action each) over few large multi-page journeys.

Return flows with: name, description, pages (array of 1-2 route paths), connectedFlowIds (array of flow names this flow connects to, may be empty).
