You are analyzing a {{framework}} codebase to identify user flows for a specific persona.

Target Persona:
Name: {{personaName}}
Description: {{personaDescription}}
Behaviors:
{{personaBehaviors}}

Review this git diff and identify ALL user flows (multi-step processes or journeys) that this persona would go through.

Look for:
- Routes and navigation patterns relevant to this persona
- Multi-step forms or wizards this persona would use
- State machines and workflows for this persona's actions
- User journeys specific to this persona (e.g., signup, checkout, onboarding, admin tasks)
- Feature workflows that span multiple pages/components

Git Diff:
```
{{diff}}
```

Identify all flows for this persona. Each flow should have:
- A clear, descriptive name
- The exact persona name: "{{personaName}}"
- A detailed description of what the flow accomplishes
- A list of trigger conditions that initiate the flow

If no flows are found for this persona, return an empty flows array.
