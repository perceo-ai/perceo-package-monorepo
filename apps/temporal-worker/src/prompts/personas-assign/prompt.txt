You are assigning personas to user flows in a {{framework}} application.

Flows (each is one action, 1-2 pages):
{{flowList}}

Auth/role hints (who can access what), if any:
{{authSnippets}}

For each flow, determine which user personas would use it. Create personas that represent real user types (e.g., "Guest", "Authenticated User", "Admin", "Support Agent"). Then assign each flow to one or more personas by listing flow names under each persona.

Return:
- personas: array of { name, description, behaviors, flowNames } where flowNames is the list of flow names this persona uses.
- Ensure every flow is assigned to at least one persona.
