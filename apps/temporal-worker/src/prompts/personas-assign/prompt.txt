You are assigning personas to user flows in a {{framework}} application.

Flows (each is one action, 1-2 pages):
{{flowList}}

Auth/role hints (who can access what), if any:
{{authSnippets}}

For each flow, determine which user personas would use it. Create a small number of personas that represent real user types (e.g., "Guest", "Authenticated User", "Admin").

Requirements:
- Prefer FEWER personas. For simple applications, use at most 3–5 personas. Merge similar roles (e.g. "Admin" and "Super Admin" → one "Admin"; "Logged-in User" and "Member" → one "Authenticated User").
- Do NOT create a separate persona for each flow or for minor role variations. Group flows under a small set of broad personas.
- Assign each flow to one or more personas. Ensure every flow is assigned to at least one persona.
- Return: personas array of { name, description, behaviors, flowNames } where flowNames is the list of flow names this persona uses.
