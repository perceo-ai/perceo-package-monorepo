You are assigning personas to user flows in a {{framework}} application.

Flows:
{{flowList}}

Auth/role hints (who can access what), if any:
{{authSnippets}}

For each flow, determine which user personas would use it.

Requirements:
- STRICT: Prefer 1 persona for simple applications. Only add more if there are genuinely different user types (e.g., guest vs authenticated, admin vs regular user). Target 1–2 personas. At most 3 for complex apps.
- Do NOT create separate personas for "Authenticated User", "Guest Browser", "Prospective Booker", "Returning Customer" etc. when they overlap. Merge into one "User" or "Visitor" persona unless auth truly segments flows.
- Assign each flow to at least one persona. Typically all flows go to one persona.
- Return: personas array of { name, description, behaviors, flowNames } where flowNames is the list of flow names this persona uses.
