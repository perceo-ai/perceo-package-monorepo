You are refining previously generated user flows and personas for a {{framework}} application.

Current flows and personas were generated by earlier LLM passes. They may include junk entries like single-page "View X" flows and redundant marketing-sounding personas.

Existing flows (JSON):
{{flowsJson}}

Existing personas (JSON):
{{personasJson}}

Your job is to produce a SMALL, CLEAN set of:
- Meaningful user flows (multi-step journeys)
- A minimal set of personas that actually matter

Hard requirements:
- STRICT: A flow is NOT a single page view. Remove flows that are just "View homepage", "View package details", "View signin page", "View dashboard", "View checkout page", "Browse packages from homepage", "Return to packages from checkout", etc. Those are steps inside flows, not standalone flows.
- Keep flows that represent meaningful user journeys or actions that typically span 2+ pages or involve a clear intent, for example:
  - "Browse packages and select one"
  - "Complete checkout and reach dashboard"
  - "Sign in and reach dashboard"
  - "Explore vehicles and view details"
- Prefer FEWER flows. 4–8 flows is ideal. Drop near-duplicates and overly granular variants.

Persona rules:
- STRICT: Prefer 1 persona for simple applications. Only keep more personas if there are genuinely different user types based on authentication or role (e.g., guest vs authenticated, admin vs regular user).
- Remove or merge redundant personas like "Window Shopper", "Prospective Booker", "Interested Buyer", "Guest Browser", "First-Time Visitor", "Returning Customer", "Authenticated User" when they overlap. In most apps, these should be merged into 1–2 concise personas, such as:
  - "Authenticated user" / "Signed-in user"
  - "Visitor" / "Guest"
- Avoid marketing/segment names that do not map to real access/behavior differences in the app.
- Each remaining persona should have:
  - A clear, concise name
  - A short description that explains who they are
  - 3–7 behaviors that describe how they use the app
  - flowNames listing which of the refined flows they use

Consistency rules:
- Every refined flow should be referenced by at least one persona via flowNames.
- If you remove a flow, also remove it from any persona.flowNames.
- If multiple old flows can be merged into one broader journey, create a single refined flow and point personas to that flow.
- Keep pages for each flow consistent with the journey (2–5 pages per flow is typical).

Return:
- A JSON object with:
  - flows: array of refined flows { name, description, pages, connectedFlowIds }
  - personas: array of refined personas { name, description, behaviors, flowNames }
