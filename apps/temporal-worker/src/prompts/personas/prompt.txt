You are analyzing a {{framework}} codebase to identify user personas.

Review this git diff and identify distinct user personas (types of users) in the application.

Look for:
- Authentication patterns (admin, user, guest roles)
- Permission levels and access control
- User types mentioned in code or comments
- Different user workflows or capabilities
- Role-based routing or features

Git Diff:
```
{{diff}}
```

Identify all personas present in the codebase. Each persona should have:
- A clear, descriptive name
- A brief description of who they are
- A list of typical behaviors they exhibit

If no personas are found, return an empty personas array.
