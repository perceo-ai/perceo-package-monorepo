You are analyzing a {{framework}} codebase to extract detailed steps for a user flow.

Flow Name: {{flowName}}
Flow Description: {{flowDescription}}

Review this code and break down the flow into sequential steps with specific actions, expected state changes, and UI selectors.

Code Context:
```
{{codeContext}}
```

Break down the flow into a sequence of actionable steps. Each step should include:
- A sequential step number (1, 2, 3, ...)
- A clear user action (e.g., "Click login button", "Fill email field with value")
- The expected state or outcome after performing the action
- Optional CSS selectors or identifiers for the UI elements involved

Order steps sequentially as they would occur in the user flow. Be specific and actionable. If no steps can be determined, return an empty steps array.
